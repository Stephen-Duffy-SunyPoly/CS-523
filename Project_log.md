# CS 523 Project Log
### By: Stephen Duffy

## Week 1 (1/25/2026 - 1/31/2026)
- Start looking for things that can be / are parallelized   


## Week 2 (2/1/2026 - 2/7/2026)
- Branch out into different topic idea categories: 
  - Image processing program
  - Text processing tools
  - Compression tool - this seems extremely challenging 
  - Ray tracing simulation - ok now this one would be extremely challenging 
    - potential project programs: [raytracing.github.io](https://github.com/RayTracing/raytracing.github.io) based off books so potential for good documentaiton
  - Cellular automata
- I found this particle simulation that looks really cool and I think I will do the project on this [particle-life](https://github.com/hunar4321/particle-life)
